# ML_2D_flat_band
The algorithm predicts flatbands from bandstructures in 2Dmatpedia database (http://www.2dmatpedia.org) using a supervised ANN and identifies isostructural groups among flatband compounds using a hybrid clustering algorihm.

The algorithm is divied into 6 modules (in 6 folders). They are numbered according to the sequence of application.

The modules are : 1.Training_NN_from_Materials_project      2.Processing_2Dmatepedia_downloaded_data_for_NN_model        3.Flatness_prediction_&_visualize_2Dmatpedia_BS_segments       4.Compound_flatness_calculation       5.Sublattice_extraction_and_vectorization       6.Clustering_module
