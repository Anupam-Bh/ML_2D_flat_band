# ML_2D_flat_band
The algorithm predicts flatbands from bandstructures in 2Dmatpedia database (http://www.2dmatpedia.org) using a supervised ANN and identifies isostructural groups among flatband compounds using a hybrid clustering algorihm. 
The algorithm is divied into 6 modules (in 6 subfolders). Those are numbered according to the sequence of application.
